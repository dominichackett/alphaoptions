## 🚨 Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

#### **Fork Connection Issues**
```bash
# Ensure mainnet RPC is configured
export MAINNET_RPC_URL="https://mainnet.infura.io/v3/YOUR_KEY"

# Or use a public RPC (slower)
export MAINNET_RPC_URL="https://eth-mainnet.public.blastapi.io"
```

#### **Contract Not Found**
```bash
# Verify deployment file exists
ls deployments/mainnet-fork.json

# Redeploy if needed
npm run deploy:fork
```

#### **Insufficient Balance**
```bash
# Tests automatically impersonate whale accounts
# No manual funding required
```
